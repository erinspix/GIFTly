AS A shopper looking for unique and personalized gifts
I WANT an easy-to-use holiday shopping helper app
SO THAT I can browse and purchase handmade gifts tailored to my friends and family

User Story Breakdown:
GIVEN a Progressive Web App (PWA) that curates handmade gift items from various sources
WHEN I open the app
THEN I am presented with a homepage that features a search bar, navigation links, and a curated list of gift ideas based on previous shopping trends and preferences

WHEN I search for a specific item
THEN I can view a list of available items from the database with relevant details, including name, price, craftsman name, and location

WHEN I click on an item
THEN I am taken to a detailed page showing the item’s description, price, craftsman information, and a link to purchase it

WHEN I add an item to my cart
THEN the item is saved, and I can view my cart at any time to see a summary of the items I’ve selected

WHEN I check out
THEN I am prompted to securely input my payment information and shipping address, and the app confirms the purchase

WHEN I choose the “Surprise Me” feature
THEN I am shown a random gift idea based on my shopping history and preferences
